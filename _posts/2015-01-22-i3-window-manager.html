<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the <a href="http://i3wm.org/" target="_blank">i3 Window Manager</a> for a little while now on my laptop. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, i3 is a tiling window manager somewhere between wmii and awesome.</p>
<p>I personally find it&rsquo;s minimal enough to be quite nice on my 15&quot; laptop, but still implements useful things like notifications, systray, and a normal way to log out.</p>
<p>My customizations are available on <a href="https://github.com/astronouth7303/.i3" target="_blank">my github</a>Â with config file an support scripts. The big things it does is set up i3lock (with a fuzzed background, thanks to Image Magick), starts a bunch of baseline stuff, and fixes the Chrome App List.</p>
<p>So keyboard-based window management is here to stay for me. Good luck getting me on vim or emacs, though.</p>
