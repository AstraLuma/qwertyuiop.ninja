<a href="http://www.gnome.org/groupon/">Help the GNOME Foundation defend the GNOME trademark</a><br/><p>I know I haven&rsquo;t been posting much, but this is Important. Gnome needs help.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t personally use the Gnome desktop environment, you have certainly benefited from their work: GTK (used by Gimp, Pidgin, and others), practically every Linux distro has something they developed or promoted (gconf-&gt;dconf, D-Bus, etc).</p>
<p>Please donate!</p>
