<p>I&rsquo;d like to write my own photo manager for my Lytro camera. My basic problem is Linux support.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what platform to use. HTML5 (in the way of CouchDB + Chrome Extension) is appealing. Easy-to-build interfaces, computer independence, etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, all the binary files &amp; processing means that a native app might be easier to write. In particular, dealing with dynamic display of &ldquo;living photos&rdquo; (stuff with refocusing and other light-field effects).</p>
<p>In any case, having to research and implement the algorithms involved sound like the opposite of fun.</p>
<p>Just watch the Lytro tag for updates on this.</p>
