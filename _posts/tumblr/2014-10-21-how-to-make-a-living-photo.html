<p>I have an idea for how to process the raw image:</p>
<ol><li>Use the calibration information in each photo to make a model of the lenses</li>
<li>Create a normal map of the raw image show where each ray came from</li>
<li>Create a color map of the raw image for future demosaicing</li>
<li>Project rays from the modeled CCD and ray trace it to your selected focal plane</li>
<li>Apply some filter to demosaic and rasterize</li>
</ol><p>I still need to process for a depth map. Maybe look for where rays converge?</p>
