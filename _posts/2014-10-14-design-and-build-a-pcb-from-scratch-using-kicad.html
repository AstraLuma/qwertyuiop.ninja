<p>This is how I learned KiCad, the electronics design package. It&rsquo;s great if you already have some idea about things like electronics and schematics and just need to learn the tools.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve watched this, he&rsquo;s released his <a href="http://contextualelectronics.com/kicad-information-wants-to-be-free/" title="(KiCad) Information Wants To Be Free" target="_blank">whole KiCad course for free</a>. I haven&rsquo;t really looked into it, since I&rsquo;ve got other stuff going on, but it might be helpful for you.</p>
