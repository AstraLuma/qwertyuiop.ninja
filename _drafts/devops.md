I've done developer tooling as part of my various jobs for years: I needed a tool, so I wrote one. My current job is the first time I've done it as a job, though. By which I mean that the majority of my job is creating, maintaining, and improving systems in support of our development.

So, there I was, having to build systems for version control, testing, deployment, server management, etc, etc, etc, here's what I'm thinking:

* I don't like doing ops that much
* I really, really like sleep
* We have more infrastructure than I want to personally be responsible for
* I really don't like being a sysadmin

So the goal being to build systems that don't put me in control of the applications and the running of them, but to enable the rest of engineering to do so. I don't want to deal with operational issues; I want systems to surface those issues to the team and the team deals with them. I don't want to be vaguely on-call; I want to build an explicit on-call rotation or (better yet!) have the self-healing systems deal with problems for me.

I don't want to own production or infrastructure; I want to enable my team to take ownership of it.

Oh hey, that's DevOps right there, isn't it?

So I do DevOps now. I guess I'm a buzzword.
