So, as a precurser to discussing how I've done DevOps, I feel like I should layout what I think DevOps is and the goals I'm trying to accomplish.

* Developer visibility into operational realities (metrics, logging, etc)
* Developer agency in operational solutions

Leads to:

* Configuration as code and applying developer tools (eg, CI) to operationals

So:

* Automation, repeatability, CD
